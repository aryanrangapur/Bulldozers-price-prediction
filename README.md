# Bulldozer Price Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the prices of bulldozers using regression techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of bulldozers based on various features. This project utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning, along with other essential data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryanrangapur/Bulldozer-price-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bulldozer-price-prediction

3. Extract the training data from the zip file:

   ```bash
   unzip data/Train.zip -d data/

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Open the `bulldozers_prices_regression.ipynb` notebook.

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
   

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. The dataset includes information about various bulldozers and their corresponding sale prices.

**`Train.csv`:** Training dataset for model development (extracted from **`Train.zip`**).

**`Valid.csv`:** Validation dataset for model evaluation.

**`Test.csv`:** Test dataset for final predictions.


## Workflow
 
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Explore the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the features for model training.

2. **Model Training:** Use regression techniques from scikit-learn to train a predictive model on the training dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset and make necessary adjustments to improve accuracy.

4. **Predictions:** Make predictions on the test dataset using the trained model.
